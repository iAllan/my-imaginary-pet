## Description: 
Tester website used to try out elements and attributes as I learn new CSS and HTML commands. Currently it is set up a blog imagining what the Khalesi from Game of Thrones would write about keeping dragons as pets. Do feel free to add on; make it something satirical. 

## Setup: 
* Fork the code. 
* Start it up in your editor of choice (I used VSCode and Atom)
* Code-Away, feel free to add images, stories, links, and anything else that would help it feel more realistic. 

## Testing
Open up the html tab in a browser of your choice to see how it runs.

## Technologies Used
VSCode
Atom

## Support
If you run into any problems, you can send me an email at allenbosire@gmail.com and I'll take a look.
